# Digital Lens Impact on Eye Dryness using Schirmer's Effect

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of digital lens usage on eye dryness using Schirmer's test data and machine learning techniques. The study aims to determine correlations between digital screen usage patterns and ocular dryness symptoms.

## Features
- Data collection through a web-based form
- Analysis of Schirmer's test results
- Machine learning models for predicting eye dryness severity
- User-friendly interface for data input

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** SQLite (or any other database)
